========================
Exercise 4.3 â€” Programming NNs.
========================

In this exercise you are going to build a (naive) implementation of a neural networks 
and use it to classify a number of data sets.




A) Neuron
-----------
Write a class to represent a neuron and its functions. Learning capabilities are
not necessary yet. Use this class to implement the neuron of exercise 4.1 and the
network of exercise 4.2.



B) Delta Rule
-----------
Add to the neuron class an update function. This function uses the delta rule to
updates its weights. The function has as input the desired activation of the node.
Test your new function to train the neuron of exercise 4.1.



C) Backpropagation
-----------
Add backpropagation to your program. Create the XOR network from the sheets.
Initialize the weights with random values. Train the network.



D) Iris dataset
-----------
Create a neural network, using your own code, that is able to classify correctly a
high percentage of flowers from the iris datasetb. Make sure you use a train set and
a test set.
Report the shape of your network and its score on the test set.



E) Weather data [optional]
-----------
Adjust your implementation to work on the weather data from the previous chapter.
Can your NN perform as well as (or better than) your k-NN implementation?
